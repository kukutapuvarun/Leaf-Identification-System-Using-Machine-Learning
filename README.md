# Leaf Identification System Using Machine Learning

## Introduction
This project is a plant identification system developed using machine learning techniques. It serves as a tool for identifying various species of plants based on images provided as input. This README provides an overview of the project, its functionalities, and instructions for usage.

## About
This project is developed as a part of my college curriculum, serving as my first project utilizing machine learning algorithms. It aims to demonstrate the application of computer vision and machine learning in the field of plant recognition.

## Features
Image Input: Users can upload images of plants for identification.
### Identification: The system employs machine learning models to recognize the species of plants depicted in the images.
### Accuracy: The accuracy of identification is continually improved through model refinement and training.
### User-Friendly Interface: The system is designed with a simple and intuitive interface for ease of use.
## Technologies Used
### Machine Learning Framework: TensorFlow, scikit-learn
### Programming Language: Python
### Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
### Backend: Flask
## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the necessary dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Run the application using python app.py.
Access the application through your web browser at http://localhost:5000.
## Usage
Upload an image of the leaf you want to identify.
Click the "Predict" button.
The system will process the image and provide the identification results.
Explore additional features and functionalities as needed.
